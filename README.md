Dario Varotto fast résumé
=========================

This is my attempt to have a CV that can be read fast, with a nice design and some nice hack.

There is no particular need for old browser support, so I just drop it for now.
Everything was made with [impress.js](bartaz.github.io/impress.js) with some hack to correct some mis-behaviour.

*	the support for hidden slides (reachable only by clicking on a link
*	and support for hidden elements (visible only when their slide is active)

This was a playground to use some CSS animation and with a light deployment using werkzeug and jinja2.

I first started a similar thing in Prezi, but I prefere to have it in a self-hosted space with more flexibility,
so here we are.
